# Goals for Next SY

1. Establish clearer roles for organizers
2. Establish a **simple yet consistent** training routine that requires the right amount of effort for both organizers and students
3. For CompProg: pilot an experimental year-long curriculum for learning CompProg
4. For SoftDev: find some training structure that works for both organizers and students. A curriculum would help!

<!-- _class: top -->

# Proposed Training Format

- For **CompProg**
    - Weekly synchronous 1 hour meetings, meant to serve as **introductory lectures** to the topic of the week
    - 5-6 hours of asynchronous solving per week (with one weekly progress report to introduce accountability in training)

- For **SoftDev**
    - No plans yet :shrug:
    - For *Reboot SoftDev Trainers*, it'll help to come up with a **plan for SoftDev** ^^

<!-- _class: top -->

# Proposed Training Format
## CompProg
- Materials will be on the [Reboot Website](https://redblazerflame.github.io/reboot-materials/)
- Submissions will be on **KHub** (Sir Roy will set up a KHub course for Reboot)

# Possible Roles to Fill

---

<!-- _class: top -->

# Possible Roles to Fill

- Roles are **NOT mutually exclusive** -- I encourage you to **volunteer for multiple roles**
- Feel free to **volunteer yourself or suggest other roles that we may have missed**

---

<!-- _class: top -->

# Possible Roles to Fill

1. **Module Writers**
    - Write ***simple*** slides to synthesize the topic for the week (show examples)
        - Recommendation for making slides: Use the **MARP** template found in the [Reboot Materials GitHub](https://github.com/RedBlazerFlame/reboot-materials) (see the [test-slides](https://github.com/RedBlazerFlame/reboot-materials/tree/main/test-slides) folder) 
    - Find **problems** to help the students apply their knowledge per week (show examples)

# SoftDev
## ~~The Elephant in the Room~~

---

<!-- _class: top -->

# SoftDev
- A curriculum (or at least a general "training" format) is needed
- For SoftDevvers, feel free to self-organize and assign roles among yourselves ~~(wow, Agile Scrum)~~
- I will delegate this to other organizers (if you want to volunteer, message nalang sa Discord, haha ^^)
