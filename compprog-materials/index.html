# Competitive Programming

The Competitive Programming division is subdivided into **two divisions**, namely:
1. **Bootcampers** - Aimed at newcomers who want to learn enough CompProg to prepare for the NOI.PH Finals.
2. **Veterans** - Aimed at experienced participants who want to learn enough CompProg to prepare for the IOI.

The **Bootcamp** track covers materials found in USACO [Bronze](https://usaco.guide/bronze) and [Silver](https://usaco.guide/silver).
The materials cover topics relevant for `800 - 1200`-rated participants on CodeForces.

Meanwhile, the **Veteran** track covers materials found in USACO [Gold](https://usaco.guide/gold) and [Platinum](https://usaco.guide/platinum).
