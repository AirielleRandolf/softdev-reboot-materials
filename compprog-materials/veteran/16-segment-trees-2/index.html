# Overview

---

This week, we will continue learning about segment trees. We will discuss more advanced forms of queries that you could answer with segment trees. In the process, you will learn how to modify a segment tree to suit your needs and come to realize how flexible and powerful this data structure is.

# Required Readings

---

- [Meeting Slides](v-segtree-2.pdf)
- [CP-Algorithms: Segment Trees](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html). Read up until the "Finding subsegments with the maximal sum" part. I recommend you use the pointer-based implementation of a segment tree instead of the array-based implementation.
