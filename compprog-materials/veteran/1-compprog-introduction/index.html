# Homework for This Week

---

For *Windows Users*: Install and setup WSL on your Device. Then, do the homework using WSL.

Create a **Hello World** C++ program. Your output should look similar to this,

```c++

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "I like peanuts, I hate carrots" << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

I encourage you to get creative and **write your own message**.
