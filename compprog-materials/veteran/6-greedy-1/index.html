# Overview

---

This week, you will learn about **greedy algorithms**. Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms where you pick the locally optimal option at every point of the program. Greedy algorithms often need **proofs of correctness** since not all greedy algorithms are correct.

# Required Readings

---

- [Meeting Slides](v-greedy-1.pdf)
- [NOI.PH Algo 2 Module by *NOI.PH trainer CJ Quines*](../../noiph-modules/dp2.pdf). All parts are relevant to this week's lesson.
