# Overview

---

In this week, you will learn about **segment trees**, one of the most powerful and flexible data structures in Competitive Programming. You will learn about the basics of the segment tree and create a basic version of a segment tree than can handle point updates and range queries. In the process, you will also practice implementing hierarchical data structures.

# Required Readings

---

- [Meeting Slides](v-segtree-1.pdf)
- [CP-Algorithms: Segment Trees](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/segment_tree.html). Read up until the "Update queries" part. I *do not recommend* using the implementation provided in CP-Algorithms, since CP-Algorithms uses an *array-based* segment tree. My recommendation is to stick with pointers. Check the meeting slides for the segtree implementation :smile:
