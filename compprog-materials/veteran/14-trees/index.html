# Overview

---

This week, we will learn about **trees** in the context of **data structures**! You will be introduced to hierarchical data structures like Binary Search Trees, Heaps, and even Segment Trees. Finally, you will learn how to implement these data structures using pointers.

# Required Readings

---

- [Meeting Slides](v-trees-1.pdf)

# Other Resources

---

- [NOI.PH DS 2 Module by *NOI.PH trainers Kevin Charles Atienza and Rene Josiah Quinto*](../../noiph-modules/ds2.pdf)

# Required Problems

---

**Note:** The problems this week contain special instructions. Make sure to follow these instructions to maximize your learnings ^^

1. [Missing Number](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1083/). **Solve this using a Binary Search Tree. Use the following template:** [https://github.com/RedBlazerFlame/reboot-materials/tree/main/compprog-materials/veteran/14-trees/missing-number-template.cpp](https://github.com/RedBlazerFlame/reboot-materials/tree/main/compprog-materials/veteran/14-trees/missing-number-template.cpp)
1. [Subordinates](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1674). For more practice, use a **pointer-based tree implementation**.
1. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm but **using your own custom min-heap implementation**. Test your solution against [this problem](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc362/tasks/abc362_d) ^^
