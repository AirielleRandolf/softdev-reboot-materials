# Overview

---

In this module, you will learn how to optimize pure brute force solutions using a powerful technique: **Dynamic Programming** (DP).
DP is a technique that uses results of subproblems to compute the answer to the current subproblem. DP is a fancy term for **Brute Force with Memoization**.

# Required Readings

---

- TODO Slides
- [NOI.PH DP 1 Module](../../noiph-modules/dp1.pdf). Note: This module is quite long. You may skim through it as needed. The important parts are sections 1-3, section 4.3.1-4.3.2, and section 5
