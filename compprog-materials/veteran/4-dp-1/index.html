# Overview

---

In this module, you will learn how to optimize pure brute force solutions using a powerful technique: **Dynamic Programming** (DP).
DP is a technique that uses results of subproblems to compute the answer to the current subproblem. DP is a fancy term for **Brute Force with Memoization**.
