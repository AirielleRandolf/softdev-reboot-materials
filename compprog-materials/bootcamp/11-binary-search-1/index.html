# Overview

---

Binary Search is a way to search for a value in a sorted list quickly in O(log n) time. In this week's lesson, we will learn how to implement binary search. In particular, we will learn how to avoid the off-by-one errors commonly found in normal binary search implementations by introducing a powerful variant of binary search: the *invariant-based* binary search.
