# Reboot

---

Reboot is the **Philippine Science High School - Main Campus'** (PSHS-MC) student-run training pool for **Software Development** and **Competitive Programming**.

From its foundation in Academic Year 2022-2023, Reboot has been training PSHS-MC students to become **Informatics Olympiad Ready**.

## Our Mission

---

We aim to foster interest in Computer Science, Computing, and Informatics through the training we provide.
We also aim to prepare students for Informatics Contests such as Abakoda, NOI.PH, and ultimately, the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).

## Our Vision

---

We envision a future batch of students that are capable not only of representing the school and the Philippines in these prestigious competitions,
but are also capable of applying their knowledge in Informatics and Software Development to contribute positively to our country and the world at large.  

## Competitive Programming

---

Competitive Programming (CompProg) is a mind sport wherein contestants are expected to solve an informatics-related problem under time pressure.

The learning guides for CompProg can be accessed [here](compprog-materials/)

## Software Development

IN PROGRESS

## Notes for Contributors

---

Reboot materials are currently written using **Markdown** for documents and **Marp** for slideshows.
Problems are currently written using **KompGen**, a Competitive Programming library made by *Kevin Atienza*.
